Brick-Optimization-Builder (B.O.B)
=====================================

A Maya-plugin for the construction of stable LEGO models

Setup
---------

Get the Maya script path on your computer by running “getenv MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH” 
Ex. mine was:
/Users/kathrynmiller/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/2018/scripts/AEBOBNodeTemplate.mel

and put the AEBOBNodeTemplate.mel file there.

NOTE: For some reason, only this original script path works. I tried setting the path to also look in the project folder with the Maya.env file but that didn’t work for me even though Maya now lists it as a recognized path. 

In theory you should be able to set the script path on your computer but mine refuses to recognize anything but the original.
